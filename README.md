# icarus - v0.1.0
A Twitch Chatbot, capable of advanced programmatic commands. 

## About
icarus was created due to my massive frustration with current chatbots on the market--there is not a single quality bot that allows for programmatic commands, which makes for a suboptimal experience.

Some cases where icarus excels are:
- Error checking: n of parameters, parameter validity, etc.
- Conditionals: Primarily in parameter validation
- External Access: This is a *big* one, allows use of external services via APIs;
  - Execute commands on a Minecraft Java Server (i.e. /whitelist, /spawnentity, etc.)
  - Control Music Streaming
  - "Crowd Control"-like functionality
